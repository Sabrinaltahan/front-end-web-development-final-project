The task is to create a website/web application with a clear target group and graphic profile, which receives its content from various JSON-based web services (also known as "APIs").

This is usually called making a "mashup".

The concept of "mashup"

In web development, "mashup" refers to a web page or application created by combining and integrating content and features from different sources or services. The idea is to create something new and useful by combining different elements.

Mashups often involve the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) from different web services to retrieve and combine data or functionality. These APIs provide a way for different applications or services to communicate with each other over the web.

You decide yourself what purpose and content your project should have. You must use at least two different web services/APIs, and these must somehow communicate with each other.

You also decide which web services you want to use for the content of your website.

Examples of solutions can be:

A website that displays weather forecasts for a selected location where a web map service is used to display weather for specific locations from a weather service.
A website that displays information about movies and actors from one web service, as well as reviews for specific movies from another web service.
Your solution must have a clear and useful purpose.

The majority of your website's content must be fetched and presented using JavaScript and AJAX, so that the finished solution has an application-like appearance and behavior - a so-called "web app".

You should also use SASS/SCSS for styling, as well as make animations in your interface to make it more alive.

Basic requirements
The website must use at least two different web services/APIs, and these must somehow communicate with each other.
You should use SASS/SCSS for styling.
You will make animations using CSS and/or JavaScript.
The website works on different types of devices with responsive web design.
Most of the website's user interface and content must be created and updated using JavaScript and AJAX.
The website's content, including graphic material, must be optimized and adapted to work for as many visitors as possible (backwards compatible).
